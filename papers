The strength of aluminum alloys can be modified through various combinations of cold working, alloying, and heat treating. All the alloys can be strengthened by cold working processes such as cold rolling or wire drawing.
Cold working
Cold working involves the reduction in thickness of a material. Plate and sheet of different thickness are produced by cold rolling. Wire and tubes of different diameter and wall thickness are produced by drawing. All aluminum alloys can be strengthened by cold working.

During the cold working, the strength of a metal increases due to the increase in the number of dislocations in the metal compared to its pre-cold-worked condition.  Dislocations are defects in the arrangement of atoms within a metal (discussed in Principles of Metallurgy).

The increase in the number of dislocations due to cold working is responsible for the increase in strength. Pure aluminum at room temperature has yield strength of 4 ksi (30 MPa).  In the fully cold-worked state the yield strength can be as high as 24 ksi (165 MPa).

Solid solution strengthening
Certain alloying elements added to aluminum mix with the aluminum atoms in a way that results in increased metal strength.  This mixture is called a solid solution because the alloying atoms are mixed in with the aluminum atoms. This is discussed in detail in Principles of Metallurgy and Aluminum Metallurgy. The extent of strengthening depends on the type and amount of the alloying elements.  Manganese and magnesium are examples of elements added to aluminum for the purpose of strengthening. Solid solution strengthening occurs in 3xxx and 5xxx alloys through the addition of manganese (3xxx) and magnesium (5xxx) to aluminum.

Precipitation strengthening
With precipitation strengthening, particles less than 0.001 mm in diameter form inside the metal.  These particles are called precipitates and consist of compounds of aluminum and alloying elements or compounds of the alloying elements.  This figure shows Al-Cu precipitates in an Al-Cu alloy.

Precipitates form as a result of a series of heat treating processes. The step of the process during which precipitates form is called aging.

Precipitation strengthening can increase the yield strength of aluminum from about five times up to about fifteen times that of unalloyed aluminum.   The strength depends on the specific alloy and the aging heat treatment temperature.

Only certain alloys can be precipitation strengthened.  The 2xxx, 6xxx, and 7xxx alloys can be precipitation strengthened through the formation of Al-Cu (2xxx), Mg-Si (6xxx), and Al-Zn-Mg-(Cu) (7xxx) precipitates.  The 1xxx, 3xxx, 4xxx, and 5xxx alloys cannot be precipitation strengthened.

Dispersion strengthening
Dispersoid particles form during the aluminum casting process when manganese in 3xxx series alloys reacts with aluminum and iron and silicon. These particles are less than 0.001 mm in diameter.  Dispersoid particles influence the grain structure that forms during heat treating so that there is increased strength compared to an alloy without dispersoids.  Fully-annealed 1100 aluminum has tensile strength of 13 ksi and yield strength of 5 ksi.  Fully-annealed 3003 has minimum tensile strength of 16 ksi and minimum yield strength of 6 ksi.  This increase in strength is due to the grain structure formed as a result of the presence of dispersoids.

 Additive strengthening
Finally, the methods of strengthening aluminum discussed here are often combined to provide even higher strength alloys.  Solid solution strengthened alloys are often cold-worked and precipitation strengthening is sometimes combined with cold working prior to the aging step.

Magnesium is a common element added to a wide range of alloys because it can add strength without inhibiting the positive characteristics of the base metal. With magnesium in aluminum, the aluminum has added strength, corrosion resistance and good weldability characteristics.
