Kya aapko pata hai duniya ki sbse tezz chalne waali train me wheels ka use nahi hota hai aur iss train ki maximum speed 603 KMPH hai jo ki world's highest train speed record hai 

Hello Dosto, aaj ki iss video me hum, japan ki MAGLEV train ke baare me jaanenge jo ki railway tracks se 10 centimeter jo ki 4 inch k lagbhag hota hai lavitate krti hai iss levitation ki wajah se hi ye train technology itna high speed achieve krne me successful ho paayi hai 

Early Development: The concept of magnetic levitation was first proposed in the early 20th century. British engineer Eric Laithwaite developed the first full-size working model of a linear induction motor in the 1940s1.
Modern Advances: Significant advancements in materials and technology have made modern maglev trains possible. Research and development continue to improve their efficiency and reduce costs1.

MAGLEV ka full form Magnatic levitation hai ki train ko track ke upper float krne k liye allow krta hai aur ye normal trains ke comparisons me completely different technology hai to tracks aur wheelset k relative motion se chalti hai

jaisa ki aap sab ko pata hai ki bhi magnet me opposite poles ek dusre ko apni taraf attract krte hai aur similar poles ek dusre ko repel krte hai, magnet ki isi property ka application ye modern MAGLEV trains hai 

agar aap do magnets ko pass me laayege to magnets ek dusre k pass aane ki koshish krege ya duur jaane ki, ye completely magnets k poles pe depend krta hai 

agar hum iss magnets k similar poles ki bich k distance ko maintain ya control kr paaye to huum ek magnetic levitation ko achieve kr skte hai jo ki maglev trains ka principle hai 

static magnets se ye application possible nahi hai iski jagah electro magnets ka use kiya jata hai jo ki electric current ki frequency aur magnitude se generate hoti hai aur isse generated electro magnet ko control kiya ja skta hai

trains me MAGNATIC LAVITATION achive krne k mainly do tarike hai, 1 Electromagnetic Suspension ya (EMS) : ye method me electromagnets ko trains me place kiya jata hai jo ek attactive force generate krte hai aur train ko lagbhag 1.03 CM ya 0.5 inches tak tracks ya guideway se lift kiya jata hai 

2. Electrodynaic Suspension EDS : ye method me Superconducting magnets ko trains aur guideway me install kiya jata hai jo ek repulsive force generate krte hai jiska use krke Japanese SCMaglev train ko innovate kiya gaya hai jo ki train ko ek magnetic cushion provide krte hai 

iss magnetic levitaion technology me mechanical contact nahi hota hai jisse friction nahi hota hai aur maximum speed aur smooth ride experience acheive kiya jata hai 

ye electromagnatic lavitating technology high speed train transportation me revolution laane ka potential rkhti hai 

Maglev trains high speed up to 600KMPH tk achieve kr skti hai jo ki tradiotionally use hone waali trains se bht jyada hai inn trains e magnects ke use hone se magnetic cushion generate hota hai jisse riding experience bht jyada badh jata hai inn trains me kam moving parts hote hai jisse maintenance bhi kam hota hai aur inki effieciency bht jyada hoti h


iss khubiyo k alava inn trains k kuchh nuksaan bhi hai inhe banane ki cots bht jyada hai aur inkn trains ke liye separately infrastructure bnana pdta hai isske saath saath inn trains ko operate krneme bht jyada energy consumption hota hai 

Early Research: Research on superconducting maglev technology began in the 1960s, with the first successful test run in 19721.
Yamanashi Test Track: Extensive testing has been conducted on the Yamanashi Maglev Test Line, which has been crucial in refining the technology1.
Chūō Shinkansen: The SCMaglev will be used in the Chūō Shinkansen line, currently under construction, which will connect Tokyo and Nagoya by 2027, and eventually extend to Osaka1.
